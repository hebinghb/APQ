Description: Label-free data-dependent acquisition (DDA) is commonly used for absolute quantification of the proteome. Data independent acquisition (DIA)-based label-free absolute protein quantification (APQ) method has not been fully established. Here we present a novel label-free DIA-based absolute protein quantification (DIA-APQ) method for the absolute quantification of protein expressions from DIA data. To validate this method, both DDA and DIA experiments were performed on human liver microsome and S9 samples. The DIA-APQ assay was able to quantify approximately twice as many proteins as the DDA-APQ method, whereas protein concentrations determined by the two methods were comparable. To evaluate the accuracy of the DIA-APQ method, we absolutely quantified carboxylesterase 1 concentrations in human livers using an established SILAC internal standard-based proteomic assay; the SILAC results were consistent with those obtained from DIA-APQ analysis. Finally, we employed a unique algorithm in DIA-APQ to distribute the MS signals from shared peptides to individual proteins or isoforms and successfully applied the method to the absolute quantification of several drug-metabolizing enzymes in human liver microsomes. In sum, this novel DIA-based APQ method not only can absolutely quantify entire proteomes and specific candidate proteins, but also has the capacity quantifying proteins with shared peptides.
